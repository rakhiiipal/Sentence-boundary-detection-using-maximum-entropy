# Sentence-boundary-detection-using-maximum-entropy
In this we have to first download apache open nlp src and bin files
We will then unzip them and create a batch file for easier access and loading of the nlp files . 
Then we will run  the program as in our code editor. Run the class file first and then we would have the outputs as the sentence being in different lines which shows the boundary line of given sentence in the program .
